Tiramisù is a MapsForge theme built to style the maps from OpenAndroMaps in Oruxmaps and compatible apps. (LocusMap, Cruiser, etc)

The theme, just like the maps, has a strong focus on hiking and general outdoor use, showing not only paths and tracks, but land use, water and food sources, and accommodation as well.

Taking advantage of the latest MapsForge features Tiramisù has three built-in styles, for hiking, mountain biking and road cycling that can be fine tuned to suit individual needs.
