Maki [wrote](https://tartamillo.wordpress.com/tiramisu/) about his render theme:
> _Tiramisù is a MapsForge theme built to style the maps from OpenAndroMaps in Oruxmaps and compatible apps._
>
> _The theme, just like the maps, has a strong focus on hiking and general outdoor use, showing not only paths and tracks, but land use, water and food sources, and accommodation as well._
>
> _Taking advantage of the latest MapsForge features Tiramisù has **three built-in styles, for hiking, mountain biking and road cycling** that can be fine tuned to suit individual needs._

The theme has now been fixed with the latest changes in routes (hiking, MTB, cycling) in OAM until January 2022, improved and continues to evolve.

Added new POIs, IMBA bike park tracks and lots of little things.

Because the theme is designed for a distant outdoor, all icons are always displayed as soon as they appear in the map data and in urban conditions can lead to oversaturation of the map and mutual overlap of icons. Therefore, use layers in the theme menu more actively and turn off unnecessary ones. Still, a topic for areas where POIs are scattered more widely.

From Tobias Kuen's Elevate family of themes, this theme is the closest to the `Elements` theme.
